Regulatory potential scores across more than 1000 ChIP-seq data from Encode that are used in RePhine analysis are available on [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NwzZ5rdhYG-QlG956oFLmJyjyBpLty6A).

CRISPR screening data of PLX4720 results processed by MaGeck are also available on [goole drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PVRZ8IrGZojku3GZYOXGag2gG1eXWXN5/view?usp=sharing) 

"MERGE" file is the TCGA differential gene list and P-value which are avaliable on GitHub. Results represent as differential P_value*sign(up reulated 1 or downregulate -1)

hg19_gene_coordinates is the gene position information files used in RP scores calculation (RP_calculation_modified.py with -g parameter).
